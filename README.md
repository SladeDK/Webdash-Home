# WebDash-Home v1.1.0

A self-hosted, configurable dashboard for organizing services, links, and systems in one place.  

WebDash-Home is designed to be simple, flexible, and fully under your control while still providing a polished, modern user experience. It runs locally with no external dependencies and works equally well on personal machines, homelabs, NAS devices, and VPS setups.

The interface is desktop-first but fully responsive: the layout scales continuously from a phone in portrait to an ultrawide monitor, and every feature - including drag-and-drop reordering and the command palette - works on touch.

The system is built around a modular preferences and layout architecture, allowing users to customize behavior, appearance, and structure without complexity.

## Features

- Multiple dashboards with independent layouts and appearance
- Custom categories and service buttons
- Drag-and-drop layout editor for categories and buttons (mouse and touch)
- Responsive layout that scales from phones to ultrawide displays
- Global and per-dashboard appearance system (themes & backgrounds)
- Quick Access system with favorites and recents
- Command palette for jumping to any service or setting
- Advanced behavior settings and user preferences
- Data-driven toggle system for configurable features
- Import and export of full system backups
- Identity system (custom name and icon per dashboard)
- Fully self-hosted (no cloud dependencies)
- Lightweight and framework-free

---

### Customization

WebDash includes a flexible customization system:

- Theme system with multiple built-in themes
- Background system with multiple visual styles
- Per-dashboard or synchronized appearance
- Adjustable behavior settings via toggle system
- Quick Access configuration (favorites and recents)
- Identity customization (dashboard name and icon)

All preferences are stored locally and applied instantly.

---

### Preferences System

WebDash uses a data-driven preferences system that controls user behavior and application features.

- Centralized preference state
- Configurable feature toggles
- Instant UI updates on change
- Persistent across sessions

This system allows new features to be added without tightly coupling logic to the UI, keeping the codebase scalable and maintainable.

- Local machines
- Home servers / NAS devices
- Raspberry Pi
- VPS (self-hosted)
- Docker with reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik, Caddy)

Once running, WebDash does not require internet access.

---

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- Node.js
- Docker (optional)

No frameworks. No databases. No cloud services.  
Designed for simplicity while maintaining a structured and scalable architecture.

---

## Security Notes

- WebDash-Home does **not include authentication** by default  
- Intended for **trusted or private networks**
- If exposed to the internet, use a **reverse proxy with authentication**
- User names are sanitized server-side and all user-provided text is escaped before rendering
- Data files are written atomically, so a crash mid-save cannot corrupt existing data

## What's New in 1.1.0

WebDash-Home 1.1.0 makes the interface adapt to whatever it's opened on. WebDash-Home
remains desktop-first - nothing about the desktop experience was traded away to
get here - but phones, tablets and ultrawide monitors are now first-class.

**Responsive everywhere**
- **The layout is now fluid, not fixed.** Spacing, content width, the search field, the clock and the dashboard title all scale continuously with the window instead of being pinned to a single set of pixel values. Resizing or snapping a window to half the screen no longer leaves the UI awkwardly proportioned.
- **Large displays use the space.** Content previously stopped at 1280px wide no matter the monitor - on a 2560px screen that meant 640px of empty gutter each side. It now grows to 1800px, showing 7 button columns instead of 5.
- **Dialogs are sized sensibly at any width.** The preferences window was a fixed 1000px: on a ~1050px window that filled 96% of the screen with 21px margins, and on an ultrawide it looked lost. It now tracks the window between 320px and 1200px.

**Mobile**
- **No more sideways scrolling.** The header's three fixed groups overflowed a 375px screen, pushing the settings button off the edge.
- **Denser, more readable dashboards.** Reclaimed horizontal padding that only made sense in a multi-column grid, plus tighter vertical rhythm - about 218px shorter over a five-category dashboard, buttons 36px wider, and more links visible per screen.
- **Touch-sized controls.** Buttons, category headings, dropdown entries, dialog fields and dialog actions now meet the 44px minimum. Text inputs are 16px so iOS Safari no longer zooms the page when you focus them.
- **A sticky header**, so the dashboard switcher, themes and settings stay reachable without scrolling back to the top.
- **Preferences becomes a full-screen sheet** with its sidebar as a horizontal strip; previously the settings pane was squeezed to 122px wide and its contents overflowed off-screen.
- **Landscape phones are handled.** A phone on its side is over 800px wide, so it previously fell through to the full desktop layout - including the sub-16px inputs that trigger zoom-on-focus.
- Safe-area insets are respected on notched devices, and the tap highlight and double-tap-zoom delay are gone from controls.

**Touch support**
- **Reordering now works on touch.** Dashboards, categories, buttons and Quick Access favorites all reordered via HTML5 drag-and-drop, which never fires from touch input - meaning reordering was simply impossible on a phone. A long press now starts a drag, with a preview that follows your finger. Scrolling and tapping are unaffected, and mouse input still uses the native path.
- **The command palette is reachable on touch.** It was bound solely to `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`K`, so on a phone there was no way to open it. A search button now appears in the header on touch devices.

**Fixes**
- **Modals were positioned against the page instead of the window.** A leftover `filter` on `<body>` made it the containing block for fixed-position elements, so every modal and the command palette were centred in the whole document. On desktop that pushed the preferences window partly below the fold; on a long mobile page it opened roughly 1100px past the bottom of the screen.
- Custom background delete buttons were invisible on touch (revealed on hover only), as were the category collapse chevron and the dashboard icon overlay.
- The button editor and the create/edit user dialogs no longer stretch edge-to-edge on phones with their fields flush against the screen edge.

Both the default and Classic UI stylesheets received all of the above.

## What's New in 1.0.0

WebDash-Home 1.0.0 is the first stable release, focused on performance and making
the app truly self-contained.

**Performance**
- **Instant theme & background switching** - visuals apply immediately; persistence happens in the background. Synchronizing appearance across dashboards is now a single request (one write, one backup) instead of three round-trips per dashboard.
- **Faster startup** - the app boots with 2 API requests instead of ~10; the full system state loads in one call.
- **Server-side caching** - user data is cached in memory (no disk read per request), and static assets are served with long-lived cache headers.
- **Lighter edits** - adding/renaming/reordering buttons and categories no longer re-fetches every dashboard or renders the page twice; exports and import previews load all dashboards in one request.
- **Smaller assets** - the logo went from 301 KB to 14 KB; the accent color picker no longer saves on every drag tick.
- **Favicons are cached** - icon lookups are resolved once per site and remembered (including "this site has no icon"), instead of re-probing up to 4 URLs per button on *every* re-render. On a 30-button dashboard this removed ~30 network requests per interaction. Turning **Show icons off now does no icon fetching at all.**
- **Far fewer compositor layers** - every button carried `will-change: transform`, and every favicon a `drop-shadow` filter, permanently promoting dozens of elements to their own GPU layers. Both are gone, which is most noticeable on icon-heavy dashboards and low-powered hosts (Raspberry Pi, NAS).
- **No pointless re-renders** - clicking a button rebuilt the entire dashboard even when nothing changed (e.g. with recents tracking switched off). It now re-renders only when the recents list actually changes.

**Fully self-hosted, works offline**
- Font Awesome and the UI fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono) now ship with WebDash. The previous external font/icon CDNs are gone - after `docker compose up`, WebDash makes **zero external requests** (except optional button favicons).
- The render-blocking icon script was replaced with plain, cacheable CSS.

**Data safety**
- Backup snapshots are throttled (`BACKUP_MIN_INTERVAL`, default 10 s) so a burst of rapid changes counts as one change instead of rotating away your entire backup history. Restores still always snapshot first.

**Fixes**
- Docker Compose port mapping now works when `PORT` is not 3000, and the container healthcheck is back.
- The OS dark/light mode listener was registered twice; dashboard identity icons no longer force a re-download on every dashboard switch.
- Opening WebDash in a **background tab** could leave it blank until focused - the page revealed itself on an animation frame, which browsers pause in hidden tabs.
- An invalid saved theme or background is now actually detected: the reset notice appears and the corrected value is persisted (previously the check silently never matched).
- Theme and background selection now highlight the correct entry when appearance sync is **off** - they were reading the global setting instead of the dashboard's own.
- First paint uses the resolved theme, so "System" theme users no longer see a flash of the wrong colours on load.
- A malformed CSS comment in the Classic UI stylesheet was silently voiding a dropdown styling rule.
